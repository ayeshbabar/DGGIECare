            <p>
              Puppies will grow up into adult dogs at different times, depending
              on the breed of the dog. A larger breed will take longer time to
              mature (i.e., around 15 months), while a smaller breed will mature
              faster (i.e., 9 months)

              category (puppy, adult, or senior) your dog falls under. Or you

            <h3>Puppy Dog</h3>
            <p>
              The amount of exercise a puppy needs is much less compared to that
              required for a grown dog. Although puppies are furballs of energy,
              they do not require too much effort, and a ten minute walk daily
              is enough for them. Each month, five more minutes should be added
              to their daily walk-time. For example, a two months old puppy
              walking ten minutes daily should walk for fifteen minutes daily at
              the age of three months, and so on. The importance of exercising
              your dog is great, but keep in mind, that they should never be
              forced to move more than required. Forced exercise includes fast
              running, or bicycling with your puppy's leash in hand. This can
              lead to injuries that may have a life-time effect on them.

              <h3>Adult Dog</h3>
              <p>
                For adult dogs, the intensity of the workout depends on the
                breed (i.e, are they a large breed, or a small one?). Larger
                breeds, if fit, have plenty of stamina. The best type of
                exercise for fit large breeds is hiking, especially if you have
                a Husky or a Weimaraner. However, some large breeds, like
                Greyhounds, for example, require less exercise compared to other
                larger breeds. They like to use up thier energy in small spurts
                so it is good to allow them to run for twenty minutes and then
                walk for the next twenty. You can also give your large adult dog
                extra training to cure their boredom 😀.<br />Moving on to
                medium sized breeds, they too have a nice stamina. These breeds
                enjoy long walks, jogging/running, swimming, and hiking, etc.
                They are very easy to train, and enjoy playtime with their
                owners, such as fetching a toy or playing tug-of-war. <br />
                Smaller breeds do not require as much exercise as larger breeds.
                They can be quite active though. Just like lager and medium
                sized breeds, these smaller breeds also love playtime! They do
                well with just an hour of exercise daily and tend to get bored
                with the same old workout routines, so make sure to use some
                variations 😉. You can do a combination of walking, training,
                puzzles and playtime to keep them happy.

            <h3>Senior Dog</h3>
            <p>
              Because of their movement constraints, older dogs' physical and
              emotional wellbeing is often overlooked. Give your senior dog
              constant exercise throughout their lives to prepare them up for
              the senior age. This will ensure that they live as long as
              possible in good health. Think about Physical Therapy. This can
              help your senior dog just they way it helps humans. There are many
              types therapies that you can choose for your dog, such as massage
              therapy, and water therapy etc.Low-impact activities should be
              chosen. Senior dogs require more relaxation than stimulation at
              this time of their lives. Instead of running, go for walks. Go for
              a swim if you have access to a pool or water. It's a fun exercise
              that's easy for their fragile bodies. Exercise should be broken
              up. Senior dogs require at least thirty minutes of exercise daily.
              Provide shorter walks and opportunities for playing throughout the
              day. Take a look at your dog's weight. Consider a diet adjustment
              or more consistent exercise for your senior dog if he or she is
              overweight. Maintaining a healthy weight will help you avoid as
              much physical stress as possible.

          <h2>Dog Diet</h2>
          <p>
            It's vital to remember that each dog is unique, and what works for
            your neighbor's dog may be entirely ineffective for yours. When it
            comes to your dog's regular nutrition, it's crucial to get advice
            from your veterinarian
            <a
              href="https://kb.rspca.org.au/knowledge-base/what-should-i-feed-my-dog/"
              >(‘What Should I Feed My Dog?’ n.d.)</a
            >. However, there is some advice that we can provide you with, but
            please make sure to check with your vet before giving your dog
            something new, or if your dog is reacting to some food.
            <br />Domestic dogs are carnivores who consume some omnivore foods.
            The diet that you provide your dog with should be balanced and of
            high quality, appropriate to their stage of life (puppy, adult,
            pregnant, senior). The amaount of food that your furry friend
            requires is based on their size and breed. An adult dog, especially
            Boxers and German Shepherds should only be fed twice a day to
            prevent their bellies from swelling, as this can be fatal to them.
            Provide your dogs with fresh water to drink throughout the day, and
            do not give them milk as it can upset their stomach. <br />
            Raw meat and bones are not suggested because they can break teeth
            and cause intestinal obstructions. Raw meet also carries bacteria
            that an be harmful for both humans and dogs. Fish (such as tinned
            sardines, tuna, or salmon) can be given to dogs as a treat on
            occasions, but it should not be provided on a regular basis. Avoid
            fish bones and go for spring water-canned fish instead than oil or
            brine-canned fish.<br />
            A modest amount of prepared vegetables, such as pumpkin or carrots,
            can also be given to dogs. You might alternatively serve a modest
            amount of plain cooked pasta or rice. Prepared meat, such as boiling
            chicken or lamb, can also be served, but no cooked bones,
            onions/onion sauces, or other poisonous elements should be included.
            See below for a list of poisonous foods for dogs:
